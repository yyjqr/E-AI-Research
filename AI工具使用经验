Google just released their full breakdown for the new Gemini 3 Pro Vision model. Interestingly, they have finally included Claude Opus 4.5 in the direct comparison, acknowledging it as the standard to beat.

The Data (from the chart):

Visual Reasoning: Opus 4.5 holds its own at 72.0% (MMM⁠⁠U Pro), sitting right between the GPT class and the new Gemini.

Video Understanding: While Gemini spikes in YouCook2 (222.7), Opus 4.5 (145.8) actually outperforms GPT-5.1 (132.4) in procedural video understanding.⁠⁠

The Takeaway: Google is clearly viewing the Opus 4.5 as a key benchmark alongside GPT-5 series.

Note: Posted per request to discuss how Claude's vision capabilities stack up against the new Google architecture.

Here are my tips for getting the most out of Claude Code, including a custom status line script, cutting the system prompt in half, using Gemini CLI as Claude Code's minion, and Claude Code running itself in a container.

Tip 0: Customize your status line
You can customize the status line at the bottom of Claude Code to show useful info. I set mine up to show the model, current directory, git branch (if any), uncommitted file count, sync status with origin, and a visual progress bar for token usage. It also shows a second line with my last message so I can see what the conversation was about:

Opus 4.5 | 📁Daft | 🔀fix/colab-pydantic-pickle (0 files uncommitted, synced) | █░░░░░░░░░ 12% of 200k tokens used (/context) 💬 Okay, and this part I don't quite understand. What is type checking and why are we using it there? from typing impor... 
This is especially helpful for keeping an eye on your context usage and remembering what you were working on.

To set this up, you can use this sample script and check the setup instructions.

Tip 1: Talk to Claude Code with your voice
I found that you can communicate much faster with your voice than typing with your hands. Using a voice transcription system on your local machine is really helpful for this.

On my Mac, I've tried a few different options:

superwhisper
MacWhisper
Super Voice Assistant (open source, I built it with Claude Code)
You can get more accuracy by using a hosted service, but I found that a local model is strong enough for this purpose. Even when there are mistakes or typos in the transcription, Claude is smart enough to understand what you're trying to say. Sometimes you need to say certain things extra clearly, but overall local models work well enough.

For example, in this screenshot you can see that Claude was able to interpret mistranscribed words like "ExcelElanishMark" and "advast" correctly as "exclamation mark" and "Advanced":

https://preview.redd.it/os02fjv5nm5g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=387d655b70bb141ab816cbc5c28947550a233c36

I think the best way to think about this is like you're trying to communicate with your friend. Of course, you can communicate through texts. That might be easier for some people, or emails, right? That's totally fine. That's what most people seem to do with Claude Code. But if you want to communicate faster, why wouldn't you get on a quick phone call? You can just send voice messages. You don't need to literally have a phone call with Claude Code. Just send a bunch of voice messages. It's faster, at least for me, as someone who's practiced the art of speaking a lot over the past number of years. But I think for a majority of people, it's going to be faster too.

A common objection is "what if you're in a room with other people?" I just whisper using earphones - I personally like Apple EarPods (not AirPods). They're affordable, high quality enough, and you just whisper into them quietly. I've done it in front of other people and it works well. In offices, people talk anyway - instead of talking to coworkers, you're talking quietly to your voice transcription system. I don't think there's any problem with that.

Tip 2: Break down large problems into smaller ones
This is one of the most important concepts to master. It's exactly the same as traditional software engineering - the best software engineers already know how to do this, and it applies to Claude Code too.

If you find that Claude Code isn't able to one-shot a difficult problem or coding task, ask it to break it down into multiple smaller issues. See if it can solve an individual part of that problem. If it's still too hard, see if it can solve an even smaller sub-problem. Keep going until everything is solvable.

Highly related to this: your problem-solving skills and software engineering skills are still highly relevant in the world of agentic coding and Claude Code. It's able to solve a lot of problems on its own, but when you apply your general problem-solving and software engineering skills to it, it becomes a lot more powerful.

Tip 3: Using Git and GitHub CLI like a pro
Just ask Claude to handle your Git and GitHub CLI tasks. This includes committing (so you don't have to write commit messages manually), branching, pulling, and pushing.

I personally allow pull automatically but not push, because push is riskier - it doesn't contaminate the origin if something goes wrong with a pull.

For GitHub CLI (gh), there's a lot you can do. One thing I started doing more after using Claude Code is creating draft PRs. This lets Claude Code handle the PR creation process with low risk - you can review everything before marking it ready for review.

Tip 4: AI context is like milk; it's best served fresh and condensed!
When you start a new conversation with Claude Code, it performs the best because it doesn't have all the added complexity of having to process the previous context from earlier parts of the conversation. But as you talk to it longer and longer, the context gets longer and the performance tends to go down.

So it's best to start a new conversation for every new topic, or if the performance starts to go down.

Tip 5: Getting output out of your terminal
Sometimes you want to copy and paste Claude Code's output, but copying directly from the terminal isn't always clean. Here are a few ways to get content out more easily:

Clipboard directly: On Mac or Linux, ask Claude to use pbcopy to send output straight to your clipboard
Write to a file: Have Claude put the content in a file, then ask it to open it in VS Code (or your favorite editor) so you can copy from there. You can also specify a line number, so you can ask Claude to open the specific line it just edited. For markdown files, once it's open in VS Code, you can use Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux/Windows) and select "Markdown: Open Preview" to see the rendered version
Opening URLs: If there's a URL you want to examine yourself, ask Claude to open it in your browser. On Mac, you can ask it to use the open command, but in general asking to open in your favorite browser should work on any platform
GitHub Desktop: You can ask Claude to open the current repo in GitHub Desktop. This is particularly useful when it's working in a non-root directory - for example, if you asked it to create a git worktree in a different directory and you haven't opened Claude Code from there yet
You can combine some of these together too. For example, if you want to edit a GitHub PR description, instead of having Claude edit it directly (which it might mess up), you can have it copy the content into a local file first. Let it edit that, check the result yourself, and once it looks good, have it copy and paste it back into the GitHub PR. That works really well. Or if you want to do that yourself, you can just ask it to open it in VS Code or give it to you via pbcopy so you can copy and paste it manually.

Of course, you can run these commands yourself, but if you find yourself doing it repetitively, it's helpful to let Claude run them for you.

Tip 6: Set up terminal aliases for quick access
Since I use the terminal more because of Claude Code, I found it helpful to set up short aliases so I can launch things quickly. Here are the ones I use:

c for Claude Code (this is the one I use the most)
gb for GitHub Desktop
co for VS Code
q for going to the project directory where I have most projects. From there I can manually cd into an individual folder to work on that project, or I can just launch Claude Code with c to let it basically have access to any project it needs to access.
To set these up, add lines like this to your shell config file (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):

alias c='claude' alias gb='github' alias co='code' alias q='cd ~/Desktop/projects' 
Tip 7: Proactively compact your context
There's a /compact command in Claude Code that summarizes your conversation to free up context space. Automatic compaction also happens when the full available context is filled. The total available context window for Opus 4.5 is currently 200k, and 45k of that is reserved for automatic compaction. About 10% of the total 200k is automatically filled with the system prompt, tools, memory, and dynamic context. But I found that it's better to proactively do it and manually tune it. I turned off auto-compact with /config so I have more context available for the main conversation and more control over when and how compaction happens.

The way I do this is to ask Claude to write a handoff document before starting fresh. Something like:

Put the rest of the plan in the system-prompt-extraction folder. Explain what you have tried, what worked, what didn't work, so that the next agent with fresh context is able to just load that file and nothing else to get started on this task and finish it up.

Claude will create a file summarizing the current state of work:

⏺ Write(experiments/system-prompt-extraction/NEXT-STEPS.md) ⎿ Wrote 129 lines to experiments/system-prompt-extraction/NEXT-STEPS.md # System Prompt Slimming - Handoff Document ## Goal Reduce Claude Code's system prompt by ~45% (currently at 11%, need ~34% more). ## Current Progress ### What's Been Done - **Backup/restore system**: `backup-cli.sh` and `restore-cli.sh` with SHA256 verification - **Patch system**: `patch-cli.js` that restores from backup then applies patches ... 
After Claude writes it, review it quickly. If something's missing, ask for edits:

Did you add a note about iteratively testing instead of trying to do everything all at once?

Then start a fresh conversation. For the fresh agent, you can just give the path of the file and nothing else like this, and it should work just fine:

> experiments/system-prompt-extraction/NEXT-STEPS.md 
In subsequent conversations, you can ask the agent to update the document for the next agent.

Tip 8: Complete the write-test cycle for autonomous tasks
If you want Claude Code to run something autonomously, like git bisect, you need to give it a way to verify results. The key is completing the write-test cycle: write code, run it, check the output, and repeat.

For example, let's say you're working on Claude Code itself and you notice /compact stopped working and started throwing a 400 error. A classic tool to find the exact commit that caused this is git bisect. The nice thing is you can let Claude Code run bisect on itself, but it needs a way to test each commit.

For tasks that involve interactive terminals like Claude Code, you can use tmux. The pattern is:

Start a tmux session
Send commands to it
Capture the output
Verify it's what you expect
Here's a simple example of testing if /context works:

tmux kill-session -t test-session 2>/dev/null tmux new-session -d -s test-session tmux send-keys -t test-session 'claude' Enter sleep 2 tmux send-keys -t test-session '/context' Enter sleep 1 tmux capture-pane -t test-session -p 
Once you have a test like this, Claude Code can run git bisect and automatically test each commit until it finds the one that broke things.

This is also an example of why your software engineering skills still matter. If you're a software engineer, you probably know about tools like git bisect. That knowledge is still really valuable when working with AI - you just apply it in new ways.

Another example is simply writing tests. After you let Claude Code write some code, if you want to test it, you can just let it write tests for itself too. And let it run on its own and fix things if it can. Of course, it doesn't always go in the right direction and you need to supervise it sometimes, but it's able to do a surprising amount of coding tasks on its own.

⁠⁠Tip 9: Cmd+A and Ctrl+A are your friends
I've been saying this for a few years now: Cmd+A and Ctrl+A are friends in the world of AI. This applies to Claude Code too.

Sometimes you want to give Claude Code a URL, but it can't access it directly. Maybe it's a private page (not sensitive data, just not publicly accessible), or something like a Reddit post that Claude Code has trouble fetching. In those cases, you can just select all the content you see (Cmd+A on Mac, Ctrl+A on other platforms), copy it, and paste it directly into Claude Code. It's a pretty powerful method.

This works great for terminal output too. When I have output from Claude Code itself or any other CLI application, I can use the same trick: select all, copy, and paste it back to CC. Pretty helpful.

This applies to any AI, not just Claude Code.⁠⁠

Tip 10: Use Gemini CLI as a fallback for blocked sites
Claude Code's WebFetch tool can't access certain sites, like Reddit. But you can work around this by creating a skill that tells Claude to use Gemini CLI as a fallback. Gemini has web access and can fetch content from sites that Claude can't reach directly.

This uses the same tmux pattern from Tip 8 - start a session, send commands, capture output. The skill file goes in ~/.claude/skills/reddit-fetch/SKILL.md. See the full skill file here.

Skills are more token-efficient because Claude Code only loads them when needed. If you want something simpler, you can put a condensed version in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md instead, but that gets loaded into every conversation whether you need it or not.

I tested this by asking Claude Code to check how Claude Code skills are regarded on Reddit - a bit meta. It goes back and forth with Gemini for a while, so it's not fast, but the report quality was surprisingly good. Obviously, you'll need to have Gemini CLI installed for this to work.

Tip 11: Invest in your own workflow
Personally, I've created my own voice transcription app from scratch with Swift. I created my own custom status line from scratch using Claude Code, this one with bash. And I created my own system for simplifying the system prompt in Claude Code's minified JavaScript file.

But you don't have to go overboard like that. Just taking care of your own CLAUDE.md, making sure it's as concise as possible while being able to help you achieve your goals - stuff like that is helpful. And of course, learning these tips, learning these tools, and some of the most important features.

All of these are investments in the tools you use to build whatever you want to build. I think it's important to spend at least a little bit of time on that.
